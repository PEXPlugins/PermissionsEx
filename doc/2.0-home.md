# PermissionsEx

This section contains documentation about the new 2.0 release of PermissionsEx. Keep in mind that this documentation is _still heavily WIP_, so some sections may be unclear or incomplete.

Just getting started? You'll want to work through the [tutorial](tutorial.md).

Coming from PermissionsEx v1? Take a look at the list of [changes in v2](changes-in-2.0.md), and the [new commands](command-equivalency.md).

Take a look at the contents in sidebar for more information!
